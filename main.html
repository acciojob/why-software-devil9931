		Why I want to become a developer?
	</h1>
	<p>
		 I want to become a developer because I am passionate about building technology that solves real-world problems. 
    The process of creating something from scratch using code is incredibly fulfilling and constantly challenges me 
    to think critically and creatively. I enjoy learning new programming languages, staying updated with modern tech 
    trends, and collaborating with others to develop innovative solutions. Becoming a developer not only aligns with 
    my interests but also offers endless opportunities for growth, innovation, and making a meaningful impact in the digital world.
