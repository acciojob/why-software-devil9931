	<h1>"Why I want to become a developer?"</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I enjoy solving problems, building things that are useful, and continuously learning. Technology is always evolving, and being a developer allows me to be part of that innovation. I’m excited by the idea of creating applications that can impact people’s lives, automate tasks, or make businesses more efficient.</p>
